<p>At Layer 7, we decided to have a bit of fun with Halloween this year.In the spirit of all things spooky and scary, we created a little online game called 5 Horrors of API Mismanagement.It’s pretty simple: you just explore our haunted house to discover five deadly pitfalls that today’s API programs run into with terrifying regularity.Of course, there’s a serious point to all the festive fun and games.Enterprises have a lot to gain from opening their backend systems to Web and mobile applications but – without appropriate controls in place – the impact on IT security and performance could be horrifying.</p>
