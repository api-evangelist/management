<p>Alan Kay, an esteemed computer scientist and MIT professor once said that “the best way to predict the future is to invent it.” This notion is a hallmark of Intel’s culture—from our next generation chips to our API management solutions, it’s with this spirit that we regularly introduce new products and disruptive technologies to the market.2014 has been no exception, and with our perpetual commitment to innovation, we are excited to reintroduce Intel Services—the division that brings together the market strengths of Mashery, Aepona, and Intel Expressway API expertise.Intel Services’ Evolution
Intel Services was born out of key business needs in the market to enable faster app development and partner growth, provide better and more secure application programming interface (API) performance, and deliver data-powered insights.We envision a world in which, quite literally, everything connects with relevant data to deliver amazing and secure computing experiences.</p>
